Here are some exercises and best practices you can use when first forming your DevRel team (or at any other point that you want to introduce a "reset").

## [Start at the End](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/start-at-the-end/)

This is an exercise to assist the team in aligning on long-term vision. It consists of:

* Ask participants to describe what **wild success** would look like for the team
* Then, ask participants to describe all of the ways the team could **fail**

From this, define your goals and key questions or assumptions that must be examined at the start of your work together.
