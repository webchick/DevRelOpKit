Here are some exercises and best practices you can use when first forming your team (or at any other point that you want to introduce a "reset").

## [Start at the End](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/start-at-the-end/)

This is an exercise to assist the team in aligning on a long-term vision. It consists of:

* Ask participants to describe what **wild success** would look like for the team
* Then, ask participants to describe all of the ways the team could **fail miserably**

From this, define your goals and key questions or assumptions that must be examined at the start of your work together.

## Team Superpowers

This is a collaborative workshop you can run with a your team to give folks an opportunity to flag things they are great at, things they want to learn, things they do NOT want to do, and what the team appreciates most in one another other. <3
